    <h1>URBANIA Siberian Larch Core</h1>

    <p>Also known as Larix sibirica, not to be confused with Western Larch common in North America. Siberian larch is a rot resistant tree with many unique properties which make it ideal for flooring core material.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Larch is a softwood species that is native to many countries around the world and yet the special properties of the Larch that grows in Siberia, are little known in the western world.</li>
      <li>The short growing season and the harsh climate in Siberia yield a lumber that has a high concentration of “late wood”; that is the dense, darker and stronger part of the ring that grows in the late summer and early fall, additionally Siberian Larch has both a high resin content and a high concentration of Sapwood, (75% – 90%) when dried slowly and with proper care the timber and plywood produced from Siberian Larch manifest a unique property: <strong>Siberian Larch resists absorbing and giving up moisture.</strong></li>
      <li>The combination of high strength, high density and the resistance to moisture content change when exposed to extreme climates imbue Siberian Larch with the ideal properties needed for the production of a stable engineered wood flooring suitable for the wide variety of climates in both Canada & the USA.</li>
      <li>Urbania Canada has partnered with China’s only producer of Japanese grade Siberian Larch Plywood; our vendor has achieved a JAS Type 1 Certificate for their Larch Plywood, 95% of the production is sold to the Japanese Construction market. JAS Type one requires the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>No measurable emissions of Formaldehyde</li>
        <li>The plywood is considered “Water Boil Proof” passing a 72 hour boil test</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Janka Hardness Test</h3>
    <p>The Janka hardness test measures the resistance of a sample of wood to denting and wear. It measures the force required to embed an 11.28mm (.444 in) steel ball into wood to half the ball's diameter. <BlankA href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janka_hardness_test">More info</BlankA></p>

    <h3>Density</h3>
    <p>Density is a simple measure of the wood's weight per volume, measured in Kilograms per Cubic Meter.</p>

    <h3>Longitudinal Bending Modulus of ¾” Plywood</h3>
    <p>Also referred as the <BlankA href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus">Modulus of Elasticity</BlankA> or <BlankA href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus">Young's modulus</BlankA>, and is measured in pascals (Mega-pacals MPa). Bending implies that deformations produced by low stress are completely recoverable after loads are removed. When loaded to higher stress levels, plastic deformation or failure occurs. Higher levels imply the wood is more flexible. <BlankA href="http://www.sapub.org/global/showpaperpdf.aspx?doi=10.5923/j.ijaf.20120204.06">More info on how this test is performed</BlankA></p>

    <p>Comprehensive information about mechanical properties of wood is available</p>

    <h2>Historical Facts about Siberian Larch</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The city of Venice Italy was built on Siberian Larch Core Pilings</li>
      <li>The Vikings sailed in ships made from Siberian Larch</li>
      <li>Many of Russia’s oldest buildings were built with Siberian Larch some as old as 800 years old remain standing today.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideal Applications for Larch Core Floors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Glue Down Installations over Hydronic Radiant Heat, maximum operating temp is 30°C (86°F)</li>
      <li>Direct Glue Down over concrete (minimum 60 day cure time)</li>
      <li>Nail Down in new construction, Larch Core Floors will tolerate a sub floor with up to 16% moisture content</li>
      <li>Floating installations over concrete and wooden sub-floors. T&G perimeter gluing required for floating installations</li>
      <li>Acceptable ambient humidity range is 25% - 70%</li>
      <li>Suitable for nail down installation over 18 mm OSB</li>
      <li>Water Borne mastic engineered wood flooring adhesives OK</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Larch Core Floors for your home?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Siberian Larch like Baltic Birch has a density much closer to White Oak, Floors produced with Siberian Larch or Baltic Birch will have a much higher dent resistance vs. floors produced with Poplar.</li>
      <li>Siberian Larch plywood produced to meet Japanese Standards has no harmful emissions and is guaranteed not to delaminate even under the most extreme conditions.</li>
      <li>Siberian Larch plywood has a very high bending strength 50% higher than Poplar Plywood and similar to Baltic Birch plywood, This provides maximum gap and cup resistance even at extremely low ambient humidity levels (warrantied to a minimum of 25% ambient humidity).</li>
      <li>Siberian Larch Plywood will resist the uptake or loss of moisture; the natural resins that protect Siberian Larch are not present in Baltic Birch.</li>
      <li>Siberian Larch is not an endangered species.</li>
